      <li>Learning and understanding something completly different than what I am used to. I expected that this new learning would be heavy on me because what i used to work with before, witch was a dentist secretary/assitant. Also about what my expirience with coding was before, witch was none. That is why I expected this to be hardt to begin with, but I was supriced how well I am doing and how mutch I actually fit in this field of work</li>
